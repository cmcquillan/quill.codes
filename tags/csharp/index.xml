      <description>You Can Simplify Your Syntax C# is a fantastic language because it constantly evolves in a way that simplifies syntax and makes the your code more expressive. Expression-bodied members were released in C# 6 and further enhanced in C# 7. At the time I was still a junior developer and had not yet decided that C# and .NET were going to be my long-term focus.
I am not going to say that this feature &amp;ldquo;sealed the deal&amp;rdquo; for me and .</description>

      <description>Fast Prototyping and Learning to Code Take a moment to think of your preferred way to learn a new language, framework, or skill. Most likely, there is a certain amount of value that you only get when learning by doing.
I had an interesting transition into development. I already knew a bit about how to code, but I had never had a programming job. At the time, I was working for a company where the dev department was willing to give me a chance, so they sent me an assignment.</description>

      <title>Set Class Fields Using &#39;out&#39; Parameters</title>

      <description>Did You Know? You can set class fields with &amp;lsquo;out&amp;rsquo; method parameters Whether you like out parameters or not in C#, they are here to stay. They decorate a number of common patterns in the .NET ecosystem.
 The TryParse pattern where the return is a bool that indicates success and your parse result comes from the out parameter.  However, very often you want to set your class field with the parse result.</description>

      <title>Practical Objects: A Beginning Approach to Object Oriented Design</title>

      <description>The Goal of Practical Objects I love programming, but programming is hard and existing paradigms that inflexibly insist upon perfection do not make it easier. This is not to say that paradigms and patterns produce bad code, but certain statements from peers, thought leaders, and friends permeate the space in my head when attempting to solve problems.
 &amp;ldquo;This approach is better because it runs faster&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;This code violates SOLID&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;We should roll our own library instead of using this framework&amp;rdquo;  I took these statements to heart.</description>
